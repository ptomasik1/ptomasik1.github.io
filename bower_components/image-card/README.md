Image-Card
====

Image Card is a Custom Element for displaying a slideshow powered by [Mozilla X-Tag](http://x-tags.org/). It is controllable by keyboard (with left- and rights-arrows on focus), by dragging and with the additional `<card-control>`-element.

**Note:** Dragging sucks at the moment. I'll fix this soon. Stay tuned!

## Installation

Installation is simply done by using Bower:

```bash
$ bower install image-card --save
```

After that include the X-Tag-Core-library, the element's Javascript and the element's CSS into your page. That's it!

```html
…
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="bower_components/image-card/dist/styles/image-card.css">
  <script src="bower_components/x-tag-core/dist/x-tag-core.js"></script>
  <script src="bower_components/image-card/dist/scripts/image-card.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
  <!-- throw in some Image Cards! -->
  …
```

## Usage

Just wrap a bunch of images into the `<image-card>`-element:

```html
<image-card>
  <img src="path/to/img-1.jpg">
  <img src="path/to/img-2.jpg">
  <img src="path/to/img-3.jpg">
</image-card>
```

Set the second image as initially visible image:

```html
<image-card current="2">
  <img src="path/to/img-1.jpg">
  <img src="path/to/img-2.jpg">
  <img src="path/to/img-3.jpg">
</image-card>
```

(Hint: counting starts at 1)

Add bullet-controls beneath the Image Card:

```html
<image-card>
  <img src="path/to/img-1.jpg">
  <img src="path/to/img-2.jpg">
  <img src="path/to/img-3.jpg">
  <card-control></card-control>
</image-card>
```

## Methods

### `prev`

Toggles the previous image unless the first image is currently visible.

### `next`

Toggles the next image unless the last image is currently visible.

## Events

### `change`

When another image is shown.

```javascript
document.getElementsByTagName('image-card')[0].addEventListener('change', function () {
  // … do something
}, false);
```

## Properties

### `current`

Index of the current image starting at one!

```javascript
// get the current Index
var current = document.getElementsByTagName('image-card')[0].current;

// set the current Index; toggle the third image
document.getElementsByTagName('image-card')[0].current = 3;
```

### `images`

Returns a Node list containing all `<img>`-elements. Getter only, can't be overwritten.

```javascript
// get all images
var images = document.getElementsByTagName('image-card')[0].images;
```

## Attributes

### `current`

Sets the index of the initially visible image; starting at one.

```html
<!--
/**
 * Initially shows the second image
 */
-->
<image-card current="2">
  <img src="path/to/img-1.jpg">
  <img src="path/to/img-2.jpg">
</image-card>
```
